# 🔢 Sorting Visualizer

An interactive and educational web app that visualizes popular sorting algorithms through animated bar graphs. 
Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project helps users understand how different sorting 
algorithms work by allowing them to watch the step-by-step transformation of an unsorted array into a sorted one.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎞️ **Animated Visuals**  
  Watch how elements are compared and swapped in real-time using smooth animations.
  
- 🔀 **Random Array Generation**  
  Instantly generate new unsorted arrays with a click to see different sorting scenarios.

- ⏱️ **Custom Controls**  
  - Adjust array size  
  - Modify sorting speed  
  - Select your preferred algorithm from a dropdown

- 📊 **Algorithms Implemented**
  - **Bubble Sort**
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Insertion Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
  - **Quick Sort**

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide a visual learning tool for students, programmers, and curious minds. By animating the inner workings of sorting algorithms, it becomes much easier to grasp abstract concepts like time complexity, comparisons, swaps, and recursion.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structuring the layout
- **CSS3** – Styling and transitions
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Logic, animations, and DOM manipulation

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Implementing and visualizing sorting algorithms from scratch
- DOM manipulation and handling user interactions
- Using `setTimeout` and async behavior to animate processes
- Designing a clean, user-friendly UI without libraries


---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add more algorithms (e.g., Heap Sort, Radix Sort)
- Include step count and time complexity info
- Add pause/resume functionality for better control during visualization
